# Pokedex

(Apologies for the late submission with the read me file.)

My design choices for this Pokedex are revolved on two factors. I wanted to make the interface kid friendly and visually apealling to anyone at any age. I also wanted the design to be simple and straight forward for someone to navigate through all the different Pokemon that they have or haven't caught.
